#Project : Serverless Web Application (Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB + S3 + CloudFront).
#
I built a serverless full-stack web application on AWS to manage student records (create and view). The system uses AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront to provide a scalable, cost-efficient, and fully managed solution with no traditional servers.
